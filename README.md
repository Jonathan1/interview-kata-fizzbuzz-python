## FizzBuzz
Implement additional tests (preferably in a TDD manner) and logic to handle the following kids game:


Fizz buzz is a group word game for children to teach them about division. Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible by three with the word "fizz", and any number divisible by five with the word "buzz", and any number divisible by both 3 and 5 with the word "fizzbuzz".

The objective is for any input n, that is bigger than 0, to return either itself, fizz, buzz or fizzbuzz, depending on the logic described above.
